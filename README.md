The final design and production files for the main PCB are in the 'rev3' folder. 

The end plates are in the 'panels' folder.

If you want to build this yourself, you need to buy three parts in addition to having the main PCB assembled by JLCPCB and having JLCPCB fab the end plates:

<ul>
  <li>1x <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/dialight/5151069F/1769784?s=N4IgTCBcDaIKwEZEAYBsBOAYiAugXyA">5151069F light pipe</a></li>
  <li>1x <a href="https://a.co/d/4ymOL0K">Aluminum Enclosure</a></li>
  <li>4x m2.5 pan head screws (the enclosure scomes with flat countersunk head screws which I don't care for)</li>
</ul>
